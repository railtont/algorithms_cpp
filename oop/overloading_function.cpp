/*
Overloading saves us memory in the system. Creating new functions is more costly compared to overloading a single one.
Since they are memory-efficient, overloaded functions are compiled faster compared to different functions, 
especially if the list of functions is long.
An obvious benefit is that the code becomes simple and clean. We donâ€™t have to keep track of different functions.

Good to know: Stack Memory is very small (8MB Linux, 1MB Windows).
Stack Memory is used to store function scope (inside variables, context, etc), and the functions order to be executed (Stack).
Heap Memory (Global Scope) is a vast espace in memory no managed by CPU, "infite memory". The heap can be accessed using new command and 
pointers to access it, and delete command to releases the reserved memory.
    * The pointer is stored in the stack

Compile and run: g++ overloading_function.cpp -o olf && ./olf
